    Best Textbook Alternatives: (Will Not Lead to Information Overload)
  </h3>

  <p class="ap_para">
    The American Pageant Textbook Outlines: These outlines are ideal high quality notes that are much more useful
    than
    the AP U.S. History textbook. They are detailed enough to include all the information covered in the exam but are
    not redundant and don’t carry worthless information that the textbook includes. Not only will these notes save
    you
    time, they will prevent you from getting into information overload mode and thus better prepare you for the exam.
  </p>

  <h3 class="ap_minititle">Best Books to Buy Now:</h3>
  <p class="ap_para">
    For many exams, buying a practice book can make studying for the exam much easier. Some people specifically like
    the old fashion way of studying materials from a book and being able to take notes. The thing is not all books
    are
    good candidates for being prep books. The best books are those whose material matches that of the College Boards
    material. In many cases prep books might be rushed in order to match specific deadlines. Never rely on Amazon or
    Google’s ratings as many test prep companies pay those engines to put their material first. For example, although
    Barron’s test prep is a good company to use, they are always going to appear first on search results because they
    bid the most to be put up first.
  </p>

  <h3 class="ap_minititle">Barron's APUSH Booklet:</h3>
  <p class="ap_para">
    Covers only the material that you need to know concisely
    Great graphs, images, and details
    Includes practice images and a sample glossary.
    Studying Could Have Never Been Easier
  </p>

  <h3 class="ap_minititle">AMSCO APUSH Study Guide:</h3>
  <p class="ap_para">
    Covers all the material with a few quick reads
    Author is very well familiar with the material
  </p>

  <h3 class="ap_minititle">Best Places to Study Before a Test</h3>
  <p class="ap_para">
    Albert.io Practice Problems: Although you might need to buy a full access subscription to this site, even the
    preview problems (there are a lot of them) are very effective in testing out individual concepts needed for
    preparation on the exam. This is ideal practice for MC problems
  </p>

  <p class="ap_para">
    College Board FRQs: These FRQs are from former exams. They are top quality material to use for studying because
    their format and style will match that of the AP Exam.
  </p>

  <h3 class="ap_minititle">Best Flashcards</h3>
  <p class="ap_para">
    Detailed Quizlet Study Cards: This set of Study cards focuses less on memorization and more on conceptual
    understanding which is the most important thing to review for the AP Exam.
  </p>

  <h3 class="ap_minititle">Best AP Exam Practice Tests</h3>
  <p class="ap_para">
    Essay Writing Tips: This is definitely a great worksheet that explains how to get passed the grading method with
    the essay using little knowledge. Mathematically speaking the information on this sheet are more valuable than
    time
    studied doing the essay because a well written essay will stand out much more than one that is not well written.
  </p>


  <h3 class="ap_minititle">
    Varsity Tutors MC Practice: These MC questions are very comprehensive and match a lot of those used on former
    exams. They also test both concepts and facts.
  </h3>

  <p class="ap_para">
    Pre-made: I don’t recommend buying flashcards for every exam because they are just not always necessary, however
    for the AP Psychology exam, I highly recommend buying them because terms and definitions are very important and
    will definitely be tested on the FRQ portion of the exam. Many teachers will tell their students not to focus on
    vocabulary because it is not tested in the MC portion of the exam, however it is still important on the FRQ.
    Buying
    flashcards is the best way to get used to using the terms the college board wants you to use. Thus while writing
    the FRQ, the terms will immediately be stuck in your head just like the lyrics of your favorite songs. Avoids
    time
    and friction. Subconciously change your mentality
  </p>


  <h3 class="ap_minititle">Best Study Guide</h3>
  <p class="ap_para">
    Detailed Study Guide: This set of notes contains all the necessary information to easily access before taking the
    AP Exam. If you still don’t get the information, try some of the videos or seek help from a teacher.
  </p>

  <h3 class="ap_minititle">
    Best Video Series (Use if you ever get stuck on a concept)

    covered
    in the exam.
