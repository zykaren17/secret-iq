    <h3 class="ap_minititle">
      Best Textbook Alternatives: (Will Not Lead to Information Overload)
    </h3>

    <p class="ap_para">
      Power Points by Ms. Cona: These Power points offer ideal high quality notes that are much more useful than the AP
      World History textbook. They are detailed enough to include all the information covered in the exam but are not
      redundant and don’t carry worthless information that the textbook includes. Not only will these notes save you
      time, they will prevent you from getting into information overload mode and thus better prepare you for the exam.
    </p>

    <h3 class="ap_minititle">More Great Power points: Another series of PowerPoint alternatives.</h3>

    <h3 class='ap_minititle'>Best Books to Buy Now:</h3>
    <p class="ap_para">
      For many exams, buying a practice book can make studying for the exam much easier. Some people specifically like
      the old fashion way of studying materials from a book and being able to take notes. The thing is not all books
      are
      good candidates for being prep books. The best books are those whose material matches that of the College Boards
      material. In many cases prep books might be rushed in order to match specific deadlines. Never rely on Amazon or
      Google’s ratings as many test prep companies pay those engines to put their material first. For example, although
      Barron’s test prep is a good company to use, they are always going to appear first on search results because they
      bid the most to be put up first.
    </p>

    <h3 class="ap_minititle">
      Most importantly, don’t forget to let your books accompany you all throughout your course so you don’t
      procrastinate.
    </h3>

    <h3 class="ap_minititle">Barron’s AP World History Booklet:</h3>
    <p class="ap_para">

    </p>

    <h3 class="ap_minititle">Best Places to Study Before a Test</h3>
    <p class="ap_para">
      Albert.io Practice Problems: Although you might need to buy a full access subscription to this site, even the
      preview problems (there are a lot of them) are very effective in testing out individual concepts needed for
      preparation on the exam. This is ideal practice for MC problems
